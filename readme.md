#  High-Level Design (HLD) 

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfSystemDesign** challenge!

This repository documents my structured journey through **High-Level Design (HLD)**—focusing on building scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable systems. It combines theoretical concepts, real-world infrastructure components, and complete design case studies inspired by actual system design interviews and architecture patterns used at scale.

##  Syllabus Overview

The learning path is divided into **3 comprehensive modules**, progressing from foundational principles to advanced system designs.

| 2  | CAP Theorem + Consistency vs Availability |
| 3  | Architecture Patterns – Monolith vs Microservices |
| 4  | HLD Approach – Interview Framework & Thinking Process |
| 5  | Load Balancing + Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling |
| 6  | Consistent Hashing |
| 7  | Caching – Types, When/Where/Why |
| 8  | Database Design – SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Indexing |
| 9  | Messaging Queues – Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub-Sub |
| 10 | Scaling to Millions of Users – Principles & Patterns |

> 🎯 **Goal**: Develop a strong architectural foundation and understand essential trade-offs in system components.
